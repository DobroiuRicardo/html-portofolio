<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ricardo, student in Oradea at Robotics! My passion is inclined towards technology and development jobs.<br/>
  Although I am at the beginning and my skills are not yet fully developed, I am happy and open to learning new things and strengthening my knowledge.<br/>
  With a little practice and the ability to learn quickly I am willing to accumulate experience in a relatively short time. I would love to receive such opportunities!<br/>
  I also study, beside faculty, an Udemy course about full-stack developing.</p>
